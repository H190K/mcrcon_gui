## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
You can clone this repo using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/h190k/mcrcon_gui.git
```

## Scripts Overview

### 1. `rcon_gui_formc.py` (Tkinter GUI)

**How it works:**
- Uses Python's built-in Tkinter library for a lightweight, native desktop interface.
- Presents fields for server IP, port, password, and command entry.
- Console output area displays server responses.
- Quick command buttons for common Minecraft server actions (e.g., list, save, stop).
- Footer always displays author credit ("Designed by h190k").
- Window icon is set using Tkinter's icon functionality (if available).

**Benefits:**
- Fast startup, minimal dependencies.
- Works on systems without a modern browser engine.
- Simple, familiar look for users who prefer classic desktop apps.

### 2. `webviewmcrcongui.py` (WebView GUI)

**How it works:**
- Uses [pywebview](https://pywebview.flowrl.com/) to create a desktop window running a local HTML/JS interface.
- Modern, responsive UI with dark mode and rich controls.
- All server communication handled in Python backend; frontend communicates via JS bridge.
- Quick command buttons, command history, and real-time console output.
- Footer displays clickable author credit ("design by h190k") linking to your website.
- On Windows, sets the application icon using a workaround (Windows API) for a professional look.

**Benefits:**
- Sleek, modern interface with better UX and theming.
- Easier to extend with web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS).
- More visually appealing and user-friendly.
