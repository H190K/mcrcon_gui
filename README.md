## Scripts Overview

### 1. `rcon_gui_formc.py` (Tkinter GUI)

**How it works:**
- Uses Python's built-in Tkinter library for a lightweight, native desktop interface.
- Presents fields for server IP, port, password, and command entry.
- Console output area displays server responses.
- Quick command buttons for common Minecraft server actions (e.g., list, save, stop).


**Benefits:**
- Fast startup, minimal dependencies.
- Works on systems without a modern browser engine.
- Simple, familiar look for users who prefer classic desktop apps.

---

### 2. `webviewmcrcongui.py` (WebView GUI)

**How it works:**
- Uses [pywebview](https://pywebview.flowrl.com/) to create a desktop window running a local HTML/JS interface.
- Modern, responsive UI with dark mode and rich controls.
- All server communication handled in Python backend; frontend communicates via JS bridge.
- Quick command buttons, command history, and real-time console output.



**Benefits:**
- Sleek, modern interface with better UX and theming.
- Easier to extend with web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS).
- More visually appealing and user-friendly.

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ - Download this if you want to fork it, tweak the code, or make it your own. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- `mcrcon.exe` (included)
- For Tkinter GUI: No extra dependencies
- For WebView GUI: `pywebview` (`pip install pywebview(cef)` - Installs the CEF backend for better performance and features.)
